# Goals

- Understand what code profiling is and why it's important
- Gain familiarity with the profvis package for profiling

# W

> Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered.

> â€” Donald Knuth.

```{r}
