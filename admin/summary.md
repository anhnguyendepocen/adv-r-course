This two-day workshop will cover advanced R topics including:

- writing functions (e.g., characteristics of well-written functions, lazy evaluation, error and warning handling)
- debugging strategies and tools
- succinctly applying functions to vectors with the `map()` family of functions within the 'purrr' package
- split-apply-combine strategies for applying functions to chunks of data (e.g., list-column data frames)
- using profiling tools to find code speed bottlenecks
- using benchmarking tools to compare code speed
- parallel processing approaches (with a focus on the 'future' package)
- using 'Rcpp' to link basic C++ code with R to eliminate bottlenecks

Prior to taking this workshop, participants will be expected to have reviewed a subset of the Foundations sections of the Advanced R book by Hadley Wickham https://adv-r.hadley.nz/ (Names and values, Vectors, Subsetting, and Control flow) and be familiar with the basics of ggplot2 and dplyr. See https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html and https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html.
